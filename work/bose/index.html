        <h4>First Steps</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="column column--size-6">
        <h5>Content Audit</h5>
        <p>We started out with an evaluation of the types of content that are key to the customer experience, and working with the client team to organize and prioritize them.</p>
        <h5>Heuristic Analysis</h5>
        <p>We evaluated their current desktop experience, and collaborated on what the priorities needed to be for mobile – along the way incorporating findings from their own research. As the project went along, we checked against those heuristics as a standard.</p>

        <h4>Design Focus</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="column column--size-6">
        <h5>Product Listing page</h5>
        <p>Bose has a small product line-up, which allows us to be more verbose and deliberate how each product is presented. We ensured that the distinguishing elmeents of each is clear, and supported teh customer's decision making process.</p>
        <h5>Product Comparison Table</h5>
        <p>There are small, but important differences between each of their products. We created a mobile comparison feature to make that easier on mobile.</p>
        <h5>Checkout Flow</h5>
        <p>They had a great desktop checkout experience, that we improved upon on mobile – cutting out fields, pages and flows where possible.</p>
