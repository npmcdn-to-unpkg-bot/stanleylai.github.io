        <p>Bose Australia & New Zealand were developing a new marketing strategy targeting a younger, trendier demographic without alienating their traditional audience.</p>
        <p>They needed a mobile storefront to complement their efforts, and our team at Mobify worked with their Global Marketing team to make this happen.</p>

        <h4>My Role</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="column column--size-6">
        <p>I was the lead Interaction Designer on the project, leading the design process as well as writing the production front-end UI markup.</p>
        <p>We were a small team of Designers, Project Managers, Front-end Engineers and QA Analysts working on a tight deadline.</p>

        <h4>Key Challenges</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="column column--size-6">
        <h5>Refining the Brand for Digital &amp; Mobile</h5>
        <p>Bose has a strong global brand standard for their print, physical and retail applications. They wanted us to help develop their digital standards.</p>
        <h5>Short Timeline</h5>
        <p>The project had to be delivered in time for their campaign launch, so we had a tight timeline to work within.</h5>

        <h4>First Steps</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="column column--size-6">
        <h5>Content Audit</h5>
        <p>We started out with an evaluation of the types of content that are key to the customer experience, then worked with the client team to organize and prioritize them.</p>
        <h5>Heuristic Analysis</h5>
        <p>We evaluated their current desktop experience and collaborated on what the priorities needed to be for mobile – along the way incorporating findings from their own research. As the project went along, we checked ourselves against those heuristics as a standard.</p>

        <h4>Design Focus</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="column column--size-6">
        <h5>Product Listing page</h5>
        <p>Bose has a small product line-up, and this allowed us to be more verbose and deliberate when approaching how each product was presented. We ensured that the distinguishing elements of each product were clear and that a potential customer could make an informed decision simply and efficiently.</p>
        <h5>Product Comparison Table</h5>
        <p>There are small but important differences between many of Bose’s products. We created a mobile comparison feature to identify and highlight these for greater ease and efficiency in the decision-making process.</p>
        <h5>Checkout Flow</h5>
        <p>Bose had a great desktop checkout experience that we improved upon on mobile, cutting out fields, pages, and flows where possible.</p>

    <div class="column column--size-6">
        <p>The client team loved our product and in fact took it a step further, rolling it out in other regions in their global network.</p>
