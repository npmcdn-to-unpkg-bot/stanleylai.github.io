        <h4>Key Challenges</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="column column--size-6">
        <h5>Understanding our Audience</h5>
        <p>Shoppers on InkCartridges.com behave differently compared to your typical ecommerce site. Picking up a new order of ink is typically a utilitarian desire, and one you want to get done quickly and right away. We saw this is the core insight motivating our design.</p>
        <h5>Diverse User Backgrounds</h5>
        <p>Our audience run the gamut from seasoned professionals such as office managers looking to stock their office, to the non-savvy family that needs consumables for the home printer.</p>

        <h4>First Steps</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="column column--size-6">
        <h5>Understanding the Customer</h5>
        <p>As one of the larger online retailers for printer consumables, we tapped their expertise and knowledge to understand their customers. We combined this with our own guerilla tests and heuristics to find the way forward.</p>
        <h5>Hierarchical Task Analysis</h5>
        <p>We studied the key interactions and tasks that customers needed to perform in order to purchase the consumables they wanted. Organizing and sorting them, we identified the key steps and optimized our mobile experience around them.</p>

        <h5>Product Search Experience</h5>
        <p>We pared down the experience to the essentials, and streamlined the steps to finding their desired product. We targeted specific points of friction, and improved them â€“ such as a quick filter to shorten product lists.</p>

        <h4>Outcome</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="column column--size-6">
        <p>We managed to signicantly reduce the complexity and time it took for the average customer to complete a purchase on mobile vs desktop. This led to great satisfaction from the client team, and considerations on expanding this to their other brands.</p>
