        <p>Founded in 1954, they have since developed additional brands such as LOFT and Lou & Grey with unique styles targeting a new and younger demographic.</p>
        <p>Our team at Mobify worked with Ann Taylor's UX and Brand teams to leveraging our tech to deliver a mobile storefront that enabled them to better engage an increasingly sophisticated audience.</p>

        <h4>My Role</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="column column--size-6">
        <p>I was the lead Interaction Designer on the project, leading the design process that defined the interactions and visual design.</p>
        <p>We were a small team of Designers, Project Managers, Front-end Engineers, UI Developers and QA Analysts working on a tight deadline, and I dived into the code often to give the UI developers a hand.</p>

        <h4>Challenge</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="column column--size-6">
        <h5>Defining the Digital Identity</h5>
        <p>The Ann Taylor Brand team had done an amazing job developing standards for their print and in-store retail environments. We worked with them to define their digital brand standards.</p>
        <h5>Understanding their Users</h5>
        <p>The client team has done extensive customer research, interviews, and testing to determine the priorities, behaviour patterns, and preferences of their target audience. We learnt and distilled their knowledge and applied it the design of their mobile experience.</p>
        <h5>High Stakes</h5>
        <p>Executives at Ann Taylor placed a high priority on delivering an excellent mobile experience to allow them to compete strongly in the upcoming shopping season.</p>

        <h4>First Steps</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="column column--size-6">
        <h5>Client Co-Design</h5>
        <p>The Ann Taylor team of stakeholders involved in the project was very large and ran the gamut from executives and managers to designers and researchers.</p>
        <p>We used an intimate co-design process to help align the various stakeholders, collaborating on content auditing, wire-framing etc.</p>
        <h5>Heuristic Analysis</h5>
        <p>Together with the client team, we conducted a heuristic study of their current desktop site and exploratory prototypes they had developed internally.</p>
        <p>Alongside exposing potential areas for improvement, we acquainted oursleves with their motivations behind particular design approaches. This provided us with additional insight towards our design process.</p>

        <h4>Design Focus</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="column column--size-6">
        <h5>Style Tiles</h5>
        <p>We used Style Tiles as an iterative approach to developing their larger visual identity. Starting with the bascis – e.g. type treatments and colours, we eventually worked towards the widgets and components that would make the complete UI.</p>
        <h5>Product Listing page</h5>
        <p>We kept the UI lean, with the visual focus on the items listed. The features we modified and created were specifically chosen based on our mutual research into the key priorities and preferences within their customers’ decision-making process.</p>
        <h5>Product Description Page</h5>
        <p>We did quick tests on Ann Taylor's target demographic, and determined that apparel options such as available colours and sizes were paramount. Rather than hide them in dropdown boxes, we exposed them in large option panels for greater accessibility efficiency.</p>
        <h5>Checkout Flow</h5>
        <p>We studied the checkout flow and identified key areas where processes could be simplified and complexities hidden. There were technical challenges with AJAX transformations on mobile, and we designed around them by hiding certain portions behind modals.</p>
