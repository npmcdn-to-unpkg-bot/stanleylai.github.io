        <p>Founded in 1954, they have since developed additional brands such as LOFT and Lou & Grey with unique styles targeting a new and younger demographic.</p>
        <p>Our team at Mobify worked with Ann Taylor's UX and Brand teams to leverage our tech to deliver a mobile storefront that helped them to engage an increasingly sophisticated audience.</p>

        <h4>My Role</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="column column--size-6">
        <p>I was the lead Interaction Designer on the project, leading the design process that defined the interactions and visual design.</p>
        <p>I also dived into the code often to give the UI developers a hand, and getting it to be just so. We were a small team of Designers, Project Managers, Front-end Engineers, UI Developers and QA Analysts working on a tight deadline.</p>

        <h4>First Steps</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="column column--size-6">
        <h5>Client Co-Design</h5>
        <p>The Ann Taylor team of stakeholders involved in the project was large, and ran the gamut of executives and managers to designers and researchers. We used co-design methods to keep them intimately involved in key activities such as developing information hierarchy and wireframes, allowing us to maintain buy-in and the project moving quickly.</p>
        <h5>Heuristic Analysis</h5>
        <p>Together with the client team, we conducted a heuristic study of their current desktop site, and exploratory prototypes they had developed internally. Besides identifying areas for improvement, we also understood their motivations for particular design approaches and provided us with additional insight for our design process.</p>

        <h4>Key Challenges</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="column column--size-6">
        <h5>Refining the Brand for Digital &amp; Mobile</h5>
        <p>Their Brand team had done an amazing job defining Ann Taylor for print and in-store retail, but wanted our help refining the brand for the web and mobile.</p>
        <h5>Low Friction Checkout</h5>
        <p>Our early analysis identified opportunities to improve the Checkout process, in particular for mobile. It also revealed significant technical challenges that we would need to design around.</p>

        <h4>Design Focus</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="column column--size-6">
        <h5>Style Tiles</h5>
        <p>We used Style Tiles as an iterative approach to developing the larger visual identity. Starting with the basics like type treatments and colours, we eventually worked towards the widgets and components that would make the complete UI.</p>
        <h5>Product Listing page</h5>
        <p>We kept the UI lean, with the visual focus on the various items. Information that is crucial to the customer in deciding whether to explore further is present as well.</p>
        <h5>Product Description Page</h5>
        <p>We found that the large options panel was crucial for customers to quickly evaluate what sizes and colours were available to them.</p>
        <h5>Checkout Flow</h5>
        <p>We studied the checkout flow and identified key areas which could be simplified, and where complexity could be hidden. There were technical challenges with AJAX transformations on mobile, and we designed around them by hiding certain portions behind modals.</p>

        <h4>Outcome</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="column column--size-6">
        <p>The launch was a resounding success. Customers experienced greater satisfaction, and found mobile the preferred way to shop. Mobile conversion rates exceeded that of desktop, helping Ann Taylor reach ROI from their investment within just 2 weeks.</p>
