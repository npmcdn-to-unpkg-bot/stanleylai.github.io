        <p>Participants were introduced to the power of design as a strategic differentiator for organizations. They were shown that, regardless of their job titles and descriptions, design is something they already constantly do.</p>
        <p>The talk is intended as an inspiration and invitation to contribute towards creating better products and services in their organizations through conscious, well-proven methods in the design process and cycle.</p>
        <p>This caught on, and I have since been invited to a number of other startups to speak to executives, employees and teams about Design, Design Thinking, and how they are crucial for their success.</p>

    <div class="column column--size-6">
        <p>The talk was a self-initiated project that I created while working at Chimp, my initial goal being to transform the climate for design by creating a new shared understanding among the various stakeholders within the company.</p>

        <h4>Key Concepts</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="column column--size-6">
        <h5>Design is Problem-solving</h5>
        <p>There is a lot of mystery surrounding what design actually is, how it is executed, and its various sub-disciplines. But really, design is simply problem-solving. If we are all solving problems on a daily basis, we are really designers in our own right.</p>
        <p>Designers have no special powers beyond a practiced methodology we call Design Thinking.</p>
        <h5>Design is Valuable</h5>
        <p>Research has consistently shown that companies utilizing Design Thinking processes have been incredibly successful and routinely outperform their competitors financially.</p>
        <p>Good design is not just about making beautiful products; good design at its core is really about creating products that reflect deep insight into, understanding about, and empathy towards the users of the product.</p>
        <h5>Design Value Scorecard</h5>
        <p>The Design Management Institute combined their research with that of Dr. Sabine Junginger to develop the Design Value Scorecard, an excellent tool to evaluate the breadth and depth of Design Thinking within an organization.</p>
        <h5>Everyone Can Design</h5>
        <p>The thesis of the lecture: Everyone solves problems, so everyone designs. And Design Thinking can help all of us solve problems better.</p>

        <h4>Outcome</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="column column--size-6">
        <p>At Chimp, many of my colleagues have expressed their excitement as they now begin exploring Design Thinking on their own, introducing elements such as empathy and iteration into their workflow.</p>
        <p>These lectures have also turned out to be incredibly practical tools to advocate on behalf of internal design teams, helping them create a new common understanding of design with their colleagues, aligning various stakeholders to enable change and inspire transformation.</p>
