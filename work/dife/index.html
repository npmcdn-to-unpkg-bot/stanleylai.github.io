        <p>Throughout the talk, I introduced to the audience how Design can be a strategic differentiator for organizations, demonstrate how regardless of your title we all actually do design, and invite them to contribute towards creating better products and services in their organizations.</p>
        <p>I created this while at Chimp, with the goal of transforming the climate for design by creating a new shared unerstanding.</p>
        <p>I ended up being invited to a number of other startups to speak to their teams about Design and Design Thinking, and how it can be useful to them.</p>

        <p>The talk was a self-initiated project, beginning with a pitch to senior leadership for time to do it and crafting the thesis and messaging in a manner that would be conducive for the audience.</p>

        <h5>Design is Problem Solving</h5>
        <p>There is a lot mystery around what design actually is, how its done, its various sub-disicplines like User Experience Design, Visual Design etc. But really, design is merely problem solving. If we are all solving problems in our day to day, we are really doing design. Designers have no special powers beyond a practiced methodology we call Design Thinking.</p>
        <h5>Design is Valuable</h5>
        <p>Companies that utilize Design Thinking deeply within their processes are incredibly successful, and routinely outperform their competitiors. It is not just about beautiful products, but products that reflect deep insight and understanding of their customers.</p>
        <h5>Design Value Scorecard</h5>
        <p>The Design Management Institute combined their research with that of Dr. Sabine Junginger to develop the Design Value Scorecard, a tool to evaluate the breadth and depth that design thinking exists within an organization. I introduced and taught this tool to executives as a framework to measure Design Thinking implementation.</p>
        <h5>Everyone Can Design</h5>
        <p>The thesis of the talk: Everyone solves problems, so everyone designs. And Design Thinking can help all of us solve problems better.</p>

        <h4>Outcome</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="column column--size-6">
        <p>The talk was first done at Chimp, and it was very successful in introducing Design Thinking as a concept. I recieved numerous feedback from colleagues of how they have since started exploring design thinking on their own, and introducing elements such as empathy and iteration into their workflow.</p>
        <p>Since then, I have been invited to a number of other startups to speak to executives and employees about the benefits and strategic role that Design Thinking plays in the modern tech company. It has been very useful as a tool to advocate on behalf of internal design teams to generate buy-in and influence within their oganizations.</p>
